# CUA4Learning - (Computer-Using Agents for Learning)
A set of materials for students using Computer Using Agents to learn how to use existing design rules of thumb and build their own
CUA for Learning
Empowering Students to Evaluate Interfaces with Computer-Using Agents

🔍 Overview
This project explores the use of Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) in educational settings, particularly in evaluating public sector and educational web-based interfaces. By integrating design heuristics, Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Quality Matters, and accessibility standards, this repository provides resources for educators and students to incorporate AI agents into coursework and project-based learning.

🎯 Goals
Equip students with practical skills to use and evaluate CUAs.

Foster critical thinking about design heuristics in real-world systems.

Promote ethical, effective, and accessible use of AI tools in education.

Support interdisciplinary collaboration in digital learning environments.

🧠 What’s Inside
🛠 Modules – Downloadable instructional units with lesson plans and activities.

🧪 Assignments & Rubrics – Sample student tasks and evaluation guides.

📑 Use Cases – Real-world examples of CUAs applied to education, library systems, and government platforms.

💬 Discussion Prompts – For engaging students in reflection and debate.

🧰 Toolkits – Resources for integrating AI agents like OpenAI’s GPT and Operator tools.

📚 Readings & Links – Curated materials on UDL, accessibility, and AI ethics.
